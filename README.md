Problem:
To create a website where users can see and manage records of known security vulnerabilities, called CVE records. These records include details like the vulnerability's ID, how severe it is, what parts of software it affects, and more.

Step-by-Step Requirements:

Viewing CVE Records:

Show a list of CVE records in a table format.
Each record should have its details like ID, severity, affected software, etc.
Users should be able to edit or delete each record.
Adding a New CVE Record:

Provide a button to add a new vulnerability.
When clicked, a pop-up window appears with fields to fill in details of the new vulnerability.
Users can then save or cancel the addition.
Editing a CVE Record:

Allow users to edit existing vulnerabilities.
Clicking on an "edit" option opens a window with the current details filled in.
Users can make changes and save or cancel them.
Deleting a CVE Record:

Enable users to delete vulnerabilities.
Clicking on a "delete" option prompts a confirmation message.
If confirmed, the vulnerability is permanently removed.
Bonus Enhancements (Optional):

Allow users to sort and filter vulnerabilities based on different criteria like severity or affected software.
Requirements in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Creating the Structure:

Set up the layout of the website, including tables for displaying records and pop-up windows for adding/editing them.
Styling:

Make the website visually appealing and easy to use by styling tables, pop-ups, and buttons.
Functionality:

Data Validation:

Code Quality:

Write clean, well-organized code that's easy to understand and maintain.
Evaluation Criteria:

User Interface Design: Assess how easy and pleasant the website is to use.
Responsiveness: Test if the website looks and works well on different devices and browsers.
Data Handling: Make sure user input is handled properly and errors are displayed correctly.
